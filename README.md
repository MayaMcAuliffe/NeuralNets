# NeuralNets
TRAINING
Enter initialTraining.txt for training data file name
Randomizing the weights is suggested but up to the user
A good alpha is 0.5
A good threshold is 0
A good number of epochs is 100

TESTING
For perfect results, test it on intialTraining.txt. If it was trained correctly,
the net should get 100%.
For actual performance on letters it hasn't seen, test it on sampleTesting.txt,
sampleTestingLowNoise.txt, and sampleTestingMedNoise.txt. Because this is a very simple net, introducing noise greatly reduces it's recognition abilities.
